- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rodrigodip and I´m from Brazil. I iniciate my studies on programing just 2 months ago.
- 👀 I’m interested in learn, learn and learn! At this point I just can learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OOP with Java, hopping to get the basis to learn Phyton.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic level learning projects. I´m very interested in practice.
